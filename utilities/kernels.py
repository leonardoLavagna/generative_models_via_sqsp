# kernels.py
#
# This module provides functionality for computing the squared Maximum Mean 
# Discrepancy (MMD) using a mixture of Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernels. 
# The MMD is a metric that measures the distance between two probability 
# distributions, and is commonly used in machine learning for distribution 
# comparison and statistical tests.
#
# Functions included:
# - mix_rbf_kernel(x, y, sigma_list): Computes a mixture of RBF kernels between 
#   two datasets `x` and `y` using a list of sigma values for the kernels.
# - RBFMMD2: A class for computing the squared MMD between two datasets `x` 
#   and `y` using the mixture of RBF kernels defined in `sigma_list`.
#
# This module is useful for tasks involving distribution matching and 
# comparison, such as domain adaptation, generative models, and other statistical 
# learning applications that require MMD as a loss function.
