#
# This module provides functions for compiling operators into a specific Hilbert 
# space for quantum computing simulations. The `compiler` function integrates 
# various operators acting on different qubits and applies them in a unified 
# Hilbert space. The module also includes functions to create initial wave 
# functions for quantum state initialization.
#
# The module includes the following functions:
# - compiler(ops, locs, n): Compiles operators into a specific Hilbert space.
# - _wrap_identity(data_list, num_bit_list): Helper function to apply identity 
#   operators to the system's Hilbert space.
# - initial_wf(num_bit): Generates the initial wave function |00...0>.

    '''
    Compile operators into a specific Hilbert space.

    Args:
        ops (list or tuple): A list or tuple of operators to be applied to the system.
        locs (list or tuple): The qubit locations on which the operators will act.
        n (int): The total number of qubits in the quantum system.

    Returns:
        scipy.sparse.csr_matrix: The resulting sparse matrix after applying all operators.

    Remark:
        The function compiles the operators into a combined sparse matrix by applying
        each operator to the corresponding qubits, then applying identity operations 
        on the other qubits to form the full Hilbert space.
