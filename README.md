# generative_models_via_sqsp
Generative Models via Straightforward Quantum State Preparation

## What's in here?
Here you can find the code and tests associated to the project.
- `notebooks` contains a jupyter notebook for each tested algorithm: the [standard Grover state preparation](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0208112), its relaxed versions (which are among our proposed methodologies) and the benchmark [Quantum Circuit Born Machine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-020-00288-9).
- `utilities` contains all the auxiliary functions needed to carry out the tests in the notebooks.
- `config.py` is a simple configuration file containing test parameters (e.g. the number of qubits and the number of runs).
-  `documentation.ipynb` is the documentation file detailing all the implemented functions and tests.
-  `requirements.txt` contains the requirements to run the code.
-  `LICENSE` MIT License.
